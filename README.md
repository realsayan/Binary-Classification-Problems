# Binary-Classification-Problems
Projects dealing with binary classification problems

- **Predict Recurrence of events from Breast Cancer Dataset** -
EDA to understand the data, clean the data and perform missing value imputation. </br>
Convert textual data to appropriate numerical form. </br>
Build models- linear models like logistic regression as well as tree based models like randome forrest. <br>
Based on the evaluation metrics perform hyperparameter tuning (using Cross Validation techniques to identify best values). <br>
When comparing the models, consider precision and recall as more important than accuracy. <br>
The models built did not give great result for recall. <br>
It could be parlty because the data available for training was pretty small. <br>
Hence there is scope for improvement and trying out more complex algorithms to build models in future. <br>
